- Plugins usually add global-level functionality to Vue
- There is no strictly defined scope for a plugin - there are typically several types of plugins you can write:
    - Add some global methods or properties. e.g. vue-element
    - Add one or more global assets: directives/filters/transitions etc. e.g. vue-touch
    - Add some Vue instance methods by attaching them to `Vue.prototype`
    - A library that provides an API of its own, while at the same time injecting some combination of the above. e.g. vue-router
- A Vue.js plugin should expose an `install` method. The method will be called with the Vue constructor as the first argument, along with possible options
- Use plugins by calling the `Vue.use()` global method and optionally pass in some options
    - Some plugins such as vue-router automatically calls `Vue.use()` if Vue is available as a global variable
    - However in a module environment you always need to call `Vue.use()` explicitly
